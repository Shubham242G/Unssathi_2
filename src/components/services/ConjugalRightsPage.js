          Restitution of Conjugal Rights is a legal provision that allows one spouse (petitioner) to file a petition in court to compel the other spouse, who is the 'respondent'. This legal remedy is based on preserving the sanctity of marriage. Grounds include Desertion (abandonment without justification), Withdrawal from Society (refusal to live with the spouse), Cruelty, Adultery, Insanity, Desertion by Petitioner, and any other morally or legally justifiable reason for not cohabiting.
