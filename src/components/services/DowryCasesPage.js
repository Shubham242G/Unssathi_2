          At times, it has been a motive or personal agenda found behind these dowry cases. The reasons might differ from case to case. Be it a personal score from divorce proceedings or to extort money from the husband's family. It has been found that false accusations related to dowry from the female spouse or her family have been seen.

        <p className="text-base text-neutral-700 mb-6">
          Here, at Unsaathi, we understand that such accusations not only have legal consequences but also lead to damage to reputation. But you don't have to worry as our judicial system has special provisions for "False" Dowry Cases.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-base text-neutral-700">
          Section 498 of the Indian Penal Code punishes filing for false dowry harassment cases. Further, Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the court to quash a false dowry case. Not only this, but a husband can also file a counter case against the wife for threatening to cause harm to him, his family or his property. But in such situations, evidence is crucial, and the burden of proof lies on the husband or his family.

            Dowry refers to the transfer of cash, goods, or property from the bride's family to the groom or his family. This exchange even continues after the wedding. According to a report in 2022, every year in India, 6.4 thousand dowry death cases are reported. The demand for dowry and cruelty related to such matters is grounds for divorce and also a criminal offence. Furthermore, it is essential for the victim to gather the evidence to support the allegations of dowry harassment. The victims should not hesitate to report the incident to the police or to go for legal assistance from a specialised family lawyer. Additionally, it is important for the victim to seek medical and psychological help to get over that trauma.
