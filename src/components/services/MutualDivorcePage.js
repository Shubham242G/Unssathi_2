              The concept of mutual divorce was introduced through the Amendment of 1976 in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Mutual Divorce is a legal process that helps both the spouses to end their marriage without any dispute. In contrast to the contested divorces which includes disagreements over affairs like alimony, property division, custody, etc. Mutual Divorce needs both the parties to be in agreement about the terms of separation. Further, mutual Divorce is a comparatively easier way to legally dissolve a marriage. In India, it is governed by various personal and customary laws, and it applies to consenting adults who mutually decide to part ways.
