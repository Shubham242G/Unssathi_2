              Cruelty in Marriage or Domestic Violence refers to certain behaviour which causes physical, emotional or mental suffering to the spouse.

Physical Cruelty refers to acts of physical violence such as hitting, slapping, or other forms of assault. Furthermore, the mental or emotional cruelty indicates insulting, humiliating, or ridiculing your spouse in private or in public. Emotional manipulation, constant criticism or isolation also counts for mental cruelty. Economic Cruelty occurs when one of the spouses withholds financial support or restricts access to family funds. Sexual cruelty refers to denial of sexual relationships or forcing unwanted sex by the partner. Social Cruelty refers to unreasonable restrictions on the spouse's relationships. It also includes preventing the spouse from working, pursuing education or socializing.
