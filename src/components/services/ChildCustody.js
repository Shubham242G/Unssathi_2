          Physical Custody
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Physical custody refers to the place where the child will live on a day-to-day basis. Physical custody is of two types: Sole Physical Custody and Joint Physical Custody.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In Sole Physical Custody the child has to stay with that parent on an everyday basis. This parent is known as the 'Custodial Parent'. The other parent can meet the child and spend time with them from time to time. Whereas in the Joint Physical Custody, the child spends equal amounts of time between both parents. Where on the one hand, this arrangement helps the kid to spend time with both parents.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
          On the other hand, it involves the child moving homes frequently, which can be disruptive to their development. Thus, Sole Joint Custody is more famous, as it provides stability for the growth and development of the kids. Also, sole custody does not mean that the non-custodial parent is not involved in the child's life and important decisions.

            Child custody is one of the significant aspects of divorce. In India, child custody in India is governed by the following laws: Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 - This law applies to Hindus. It emphasises that the welfare of the child is the primary consideration. Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 - This secular law applies to all communities. The main goal of this law is to appoint a guardian who will take care of the child's interests and nurture them. Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 - The Muslim personal law governs the child custody rights and the guardianship matters of Muslims. Hizanat or child custody is usually granted to the mothers, and the fathers receive the child visitation rights. Christian and Parsi Law - The child custody disputes of Christian and Parsi individuals are now resolved under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 or the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.
